        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Ground</h3>
            The ground is made up of rectangular huts, it is entirely bordered by
            walls. The surface of the ground is not known by the BOT! A BOT occupies
            one square. One unit of energy occupies one square.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Simulation</h3>
            A game round consists of a communication sequence between the simulator and a bot.
            Simulator: executes the energy consumption for a BOT
            BOT: determines the terrain scan level from 0 to 255
            Simulator: scanning takes place
            BOT : Determines an action (none, move, shoot, shield, hide, ...)
            Simulator: executes the action and applies the changes if any
            The simulator moves on to the next BOT.
            Each BOT is notified immediately as soon as one of its characteristics is changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Bot caracteristics</h3>
            A BOT has only one life. He loses his
            life if his energy level drops to zero. It is simply disconnected from
            the server.
            Each BOT starts with 100 units of energy.
            A BOT has lost if its energy reserve falls to zero.
            There is no limit to energy storage
            There is a loss of at least 1 unit of energy for each turn, even without any detection or action taken.
            Energy is consumed by the detection
            Energy is consumed by actions, shocks, blows received...
            Energy can be recovered in the field
            At the beginning of each round, the energy injected into the surrounding sensor must be indicated.
            0 : no information will be captured
            1 to 255: information from a distance of x boxes will be captured. This also corresponds to the energy consumed by this scan!
        </p>
    <p>
            <h3>Item caracteristics</h3>
            <h4>Energy capsules</h4>
        <p>
            On the playground, it is possible to find energy capsules.
            Simply pass over an energy capsule to retrieve its contents.
            Energy capsules will appear randomly on the field.
        </p>
        <h4>Protection</h4>
        <p>
            It is possible to activate a protective shield. It will be assigned a certain power level, which will be deducted in energy units for activation.
            At each turn it will consume 1 unit of energy to maintain its power level.
            If you take 1 hit, it loses 1 unit of power.
            If its power drops to zero, it is then inactive.
            It is possible to re-inject units of energy to increase the power level.
            When the shield is deactivated, the current power level of the shield is recovered in units of energy.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Cloaks</h4>
            It's possible to make yourself invisible by activating an occulting field. It will be assigned a certain level of power which will be deducted in units of energy for activation. This power level is the distance at which the occulting field is active.
            Example: With a level 3, an enemy at a distance <= 3 will not detect us, an enemy further than 3 will be able to detect us.
            At each turn it will consume 1 unit of energy to maintain its power level.
            If you take 1 hit, it is automatically deactivated (and its energy is lost).
            When the occulting field is deactivated, the power level of the occulting field is recovered in units of energy.
        </p>
    </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Move rules</h3>
            It is possible to move one box in the 4 directions : north, south, east and west.
            The box must be empty or contain an energy capsule.
            If the box contains an energy capsule: the energy contained in this capsule is then absorbed.
            If the box is occupied by a block: loss of 1 in energy
            If the box is occupied by another Bot, each Bot loses one in energy.
